This is a step-by-step guide written in an informal, friendly style, for beginners to learn building cross-platform mobile applications with PhoneGap. You will find plenty of fully explained code and ample screenshots in the book to ease and speed up your understanding. This book is for developers, ideally with web development experience, who are interested in developing for the emerging mobile market, but do not want to learn a new SDK for every phone on the shelf. Readers should be comfortable with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and interested in learning the new advances in those technologies that allow for rich, native-style experiences.
