Apache Cordova API Cookbook provides experienced mobile developers with details about how each Cordova API works and how to use the APIs in their own applications. Using Apache Cordova, mobile developers can write cross-platform mobile apps using standard HTML 5, JavaScript, and CSS, and then deploy those apps to every leading mobile platform with little or no re-coding. Coverage is included for all Cordova/PhoneGap 3 APIs.
Instead of just showing short snippets of code to explain a particular API, the book is chock full of complete, contextual examples. Inside the book, you’ll find more than 30 complete Cordova applications; chapter content highlights how those applications look and work on Android, iOS, Windows and more. The sample applications provide developers with applications they can run on every Cordova supported mobile device platform to see exactly what the API does, how it works and what the limitations are on each platform.
