Apache Cordova 3 Programming  is a complete introduction to Apache Cordova 3 and Adobe PhoneGap 3.  It describes what makes Cordova important and shows how to install and use the tools, the new Cordova CLI, the native SDKs, and more. For those brand new to Cordova, this book is what you need to get started. If you’re familiar with an older version of Cordova, this book shows you how to use the new stuff that’s in Cordova 3 plus stuff that has been around for a while (like the Cordova core APIs).

The book shows you how to install and use the command line tools to manage the Cordova application lifecycle and how to set up and use development environments for several of the more popular Cordova supported mobile device platforms. For new developers are chapters on the anatomy of a Cordova application & the mechanics of Cordova development. He covers the tools you can use to test and debug your Cordova applications and create your own plugins.
