Instant PhoneGap starts with the basics of PhoneGap and enables users to create application in PhoneGap and submit it to different app stores such as Android and iOS.

Users will learn the basics of PhoneGap, get started with building their first app, and gradually work on complex tasks like building and improving the CSS defining the app style, font, colors, and views using jQuery themes. They will learn to edit the index.html file to include the correct JavaScript; use the PhoneGap geolocation API to locate restaurants on a map and monitor user's current position; and finally users will learn to review code, get the certificates from the OS to deploy app, and build it using PhoneGap Build.
